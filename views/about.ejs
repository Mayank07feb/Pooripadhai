      <p class="text-base md:text-h6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Poori Padhai is a team of dedicated and hardworking people which include people from different background who
        had gone through almost all the problems which a student faces generally while completing their higher education
        or competing in the different type of competitive exams in our country.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base md:text-h6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        It is very hard to cope up with the difficulties that come in front of us while going through our higher
        education, first one we face is what curriculum or field to choose, what university to opt, what college to opt
        and many more. But one of the biggest problems we face is the language barrier, as coming from the rural setting
        and even though state boards most of the students are not very comfortable with the English language which is
        the most preferred language for higher education. So despite being an excellent student, they end up doing
        mediocre. We have the vision to solve these little problems and help improve the standard of our higher
        education in our country. And if we are successful in helping even a single student we'll find our endeavor was
        not in vain.
